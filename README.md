Intial setup 
1. Get Telegram Bot token ready
2. Install and launch Signal Desktop [BETA VERSION](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-Signal-Beta)
    - Goto Menu

		- Store somehwere output of `window.SignalDebug.getReduxState().items.uuid_id`
		- Also store output of `window.SignalDebug.getReduxState().items.password`

#### Don't share both of these with anyone else

#### How to see what all packs i converted with this script ?

```
cat packs

```

#### Background 

For v3, v2 and binary you need just the link to stickerpack, __NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD TGS FILES__
Just have links like "https://t.me/addstickers/HalloUtya" and that's enough !!!!

For bot to upload on your behalf, using your account credentials given above.

If you want telegram bot token get it using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) :")

Once Intial setup , from next time just sending link would be enough.

### Usage of v3 script  (for v2 change name)

```
./script_v3_beta.sh 

./script_v3_beta.sh <filename>

Where file has list of Telegram sticker links
```

### Usage of Binary 
```
cargo r --release <link> <link> <link>
```

<details><summary> Internal working of v1 and v2 </summary>
Usage of v1 of script 

```
./script_v1.sh

Converts tgs in current diretory to apng within ./outut
```
You could use it to : 

1. To create custom stickerpack from group of tgs files
2. You don't need to have telegram account , although you need source of tgs files
Dependencies of v1 of script 
1. gifsicle 
2. imagemagick 
3. apngasm 
4. tgs-to-gif 

Prefer v2 since it does job automated.
